Hi ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Istanbul Kultur University Mathematics and Computer Sciences in 2019. While studying at my university, I tried to improve myself and develop new projects at the same time.

I'm trying to get into start-up projects that I find logical. I have worked actively in the backend and frontend parts of the proposed projects and I am still working.

I am willing to develop myself in Javascript-based libraries and frameworks.
